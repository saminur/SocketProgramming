This program will be used to transfer files from client to server. Server will be listening on a port (say port# 5050) and Client will connect to Server and transfer files to Server. Here are details:
  1. Client should accept command line parameter to set the number of concurrent file transfers. For example, java Client 5 will transfer five files concurrently at any given time      as long as there are enough files.  If concurrency number is not entered, it should transfer one file at a time (aka concurrency=1), by default.
  2. The application should support integrity verification. That is, client and server will calculate checksum of files after itâ€™s transferred and compare them to make sure            data is transferred without any error.
  3. test scenarios.
      a) Create a dataset with 100 files each 10MB size and transfer with concurrency 1, 2,4 and 8 and measure throughput
      b) Create a dataset with 10 files each 1GB size and transfer with concurrency 1, 2, 4 and 8 and measure throughput
      c) Combine above two datasets in a single dataset and transfer with concurrency 1,2,4 and 8 and measure throughput
  4. After tests are done, draw figure for each tests case in item#2 where x-axis is concurrency value and y-axis is throughput.
  
  
Server End Run:

javac -cp . com/sami/Server/*.java
java -cp . com/sami/Server/FileRecieveServer

Client End Run:

javac -cp . com/sami/Client/*.java
java -cp . com/sami/Client/ConcurrencyHandler

File creation:

javac -cp . com/sami/creatFile/*.java
100 files of 10 MB = java -cp . com/sami/creatFile/DataSetCreation
10 files of 1 GB = java -cp . com/sami/creatFile/DataSetCreationGB
